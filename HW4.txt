1. Added two new functions to display posts and DMS from users
2. Went back and fixed formatting error with dispaly friends and display users, zip varaible was a int but would get rid of leading zeros so used stringstream to fix that with setw and setfill
3. Fixed organization in the case/switch code in main.cpp, so case #s match with current and previous homework
4. 13/14 are for reading user data and post data, included with submission
5. For checking whether object in message vector was of type parent or child used typeid
